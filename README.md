Project details:  <br/>
Its an sample application that works with external biometric devices. At first the user is registered with their biometric data which is stored in a server. Later, we read the user fingerprint using the device and proceed further with the user verified by matching fingerprint with existing data stored on the server. This project uses an external device driver and sdk, which we use to connect and get data from the biometric device. This code is part of the demo project done for a client.This application was developed targeting .net framework.
